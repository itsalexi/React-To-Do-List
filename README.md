# React-To-Do-List
A really simple To-Do list created in React for The Odin Project.

Wasn't on planning to upload this to GitHub because I thought it would be easy but adding the functionality to remove tasks was pretty hard in my opinion but in the end I figured it out and I just wanted to share it!

Let me know if you have any feedback for my code!
